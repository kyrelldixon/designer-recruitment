# Designer Recruitment

> A site made exclusively to help me find a web designer.

If you're checking this out and are a web/UI/UX designer, contact me! I'm open to working with anyone that has genuine interest in web design and working with a web developer to see sites come to life.

If you're just here for the code, here's how you get set up:

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyrelldixon/designer-recruitment.git
```

2. **Start developing.**

```bash
cd designer-recruitment
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

Open the `designer-recruitment` directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
